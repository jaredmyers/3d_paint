# 3d Paint
3d paint is a fun three dimensional WebGL application powered by unity and scripted in C sharp.

The program allows for 3 differently shaped paint strokes with 3 variations each, for a total of 9 different paint stokes. There are also various controls for motion manipulation, speed, color, and sizing. Below are some snapshots, links, and an example flow diagram illustrating controls.
